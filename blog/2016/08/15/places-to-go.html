          <p>Hello everyone! Svetlozar T. from the EuRuKo 2016 team here.  In our previous blog post we covered some info on how to get to the venue and
where to sleep. Hope this has been useful!</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will take a look at some info about Sofia and its sights.</p>

<h2 id="historical-sights">Historical Sights</h2>

<p>As you might already know, Sofia, or at least the area that the city spans, has
been inhabited as early as 7000 BC. For centuries, this has been the city of
Thracians, Byzantines, Slavs and Bulgars. It has been the residence of Roman
emperors, an administrative centre under the First Bulgarian Kingdom, and a
capital of an Ottoman province. You can see a monument of almost each
historical era inside the city.</p>

<p><img alt="roman" src="../../../../images/2016-08-15-places-to-go/roman-4a252020.jpg" /></p>

<p>For example, if you take a walk around Serdika metro station, you can see the
oldest building in Sofia - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._George,_Sofia">Church of Saint George</a>.</p>

<p>Built in the 4th century, it was a part of a larger complex. Watching the
ancient ruins around it, one can imagine a small district built alongside the
Roman road. Some of the buildings even had underfloor heating - look for the
square tiles. The church itself is most famous for its murals, dating all the
way back to 10th century.</p>

<p><img alt="baths" src="../../../../images/2016-08-15-places-to-go/baths-1ff6f3f6.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you are wondering how the heating worked, the answer is: hot springs. Sofia
is famous for its many mineral hot springs. If you go just past the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Central_Mineral_Baths">Sofia
Central Bath</a>, you will see people filling bottles of hot mineral water. The
taps are free to use and the mineral water is fresh from the hot spring.</p>

<p><img alt="st. sofia" src="../../../../images/2016-08-15-places-to-go/sofia-bc10afc7.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can find another ancient building further to the east - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sofia_Church,_Sofia">Saint Sofia
Church</a>. It dates back to the 6th century, and stands in the middle of what was
once an ancient necropolis. You can even visit some of the unearthed tombs
below the church. Also, St. Sofia gave the city its name in the 14th century.</p>

<p><img alt="nevsky" src="../../../../images/2016-08-15-places-to-go/nevsky-3ac1723e.jpg" /></p>

<p>Just next to St. Sofia church is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Cathedral,_Sofia">Alexander Nevsky Cathedral</a>. Not long ago
it boasted the title of the world's biggest Orthodox cathedral. It's currently
running third, but even so, it's impressive. If you enjoy the quiet grandeur of
large wall murals, or you want to see how the interior of a (rather large)
Orthodox church looks like - pay it a visit. There is no entrance free, but
make sure to visit before closing time (around 7:30pm).</p>

<h2 id="present-day">Present Day</h2>

<p>Sofia is the capital city of Bulgaria, and its population is about 1.26 million
people. Apart from the traffic jams and crowds in public transport in peak
hours, it rarely feels crowded.</p>

<p><img alt="vitoshka" src="../../../../images/2016-08-15-places-to-go/vitoshka-c7a7996f.jpg" /></p>

<p>That said, one might still feel a bit overwhelmed by the pedestrian traffic on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitosha_Boulevard">Vitosha boulevard</a> on weekends. Vitosha boulevard bridges the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDK_Metro_Station">NDK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serdika_Metro_Station">Serdika</a> metro stations. It is one of the places that locals go to
for brand shopping. It also has restaurants, bars, ice-cream shops, so it can
be a nice walk on a bustling evening. There are even more restaurants scattered
about the cross-streets. But, more about this in our dedicated blog post about
food in Sofia.</p>

<p>Not far away from Vitosha boulevard is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Garden_(Sofia)">City Garden</a>, right next to the National
Theater. This is one of the places to go if you feel like hanging out among
Sofia's youth. It's another lively place where you can bring a beer and hang
out on the benches or near the fountain. You could then walk to the Krystal
garden, just a couple of streets away, to have a drink at the Krystal bar.</p>

<p>If street art is more up your alley, make your way to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/406642430/">Tsar Shishman</a> street and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Rakovski_Street">Rakovski</a> street. Tsar Shishman is a good casual walk starting at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sveti_Sedmochislenitsi_Church">Sveti
Sedmochislenitsi Church</a>. The area around the church itself is another lively
spot of Sofia. Most of the graffiti along Shishman street appear on the power
substations, but you can also spot some on the odd wall. Rakovski street is a
rather busy street bustling with traffic. It is also known as the Bulgarian
Broadway, because of its many theaters. Again, you should be looking at the
power substations for the bulk of graffiti art here.</p>

<p>Finally, to justify the title of this blog post, here is some valuable info about the Pokémon Go fans among you. As it turns out, one of the biggest Pokéstops in Sofia is just outside the National Palace of Culture. So, even if you feel the urge to go for some Pokémon hunting, you know where to look.</p>

<p>These are but a few places that we would recommend checking out. There is
plenty to do and plenty to see in Sofia. Keep an eye out for a special blog
post dedicated to gluttony and how to deal with it in Sofia.</p>
