Last Minute Beer + Pizza Pre-Event Party

The response for this year’s EuRuKo is outstanding! That’s why we decided to organize a small pre-registration event for those of you, who will be in Sofia on 22nd September. Thanks to our amazing friends at CowOrKing Space by Puzl, we’ll be able to host the early registration on Thursday at their coworking space. 

CowOrKing Space by Puzl is one of the fastest growing coworking spaces in Bulgaria and is currently on a mission to facilitate the community of innovative Bulgarian startups in the IT industry. It seems there’s no better place for us to be at!  Check out their Facebook page and don’t forget to show them some love and support!

Come grab your badge on Thursday and help us offload the lines on Friday. The beer and pizza will be on us! 

Here’s the deal:

You'll recognize the tall building by a big sign that says “SIVEN”. The main entrance is a sliding door right next to the entrance of LIDL supermarket. Once you’re there, just take the elevator to floor 4.

See you there!
