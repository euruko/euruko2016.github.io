Hello everyone! Svetlozar T. from the EuRuKo 2016 team here, bringing you some
more info about Sofia, the host city of this year's conference. If it's your
first time coming to Sofia, don't worry - the end of September usually still
retains the charm of late summer, minus the hot weather.

In our first blog post, let's cover some basic info about getting around Sofia,
namely public transport and accommodation.

## Affordable public transport

Public transport in Sofia is cheap. There are three types of it - buses, trams
and underground railway (Metro). We recommend using the Metro for your visit
here, as it should be the easiest way for you to get to and from the venue.

The ticket machines at the Metro stations only sell single-ride tickets, at the
price of 1.6 leva, or 80 eurocents. While most of them accept only coins, you
can use paper money at some of them. Make sure you have banknotes of 2, 5 or 10
leva, as they don't accept banknotes of 20 and above. Also, if you’re
travelling with bulkier luggage (if the dimensions exceed 60х40х40 cm), make
sure to take another ticket for your luggage.

There are only two lines of underground trains in Sofia - Line 1 (<span
style="color: red">red</span>), and Line 2 (<span style="color:
blue">blue</span>). Line 1 connects the districts of Lyulin and Mladost, while
Line 2 connects the Obelya and Lozenets districts. The National Palace of
Culture (NDK) station is on the blue line.  If you're coming directly from the
airport, you should change at Serdika station (<span style="color:
red">red</span>) and take the train in the <span>Lozenets</span> (<span
style="color: blue">blue</span>)  direction. You will need to get off at the
next station – NDK.

If your flight arrives late, your only option might be taking a taxi to the
city center. You may wanna avoid taking a taxi from the folks right at the
arrival section.  On both terminals, there are regulated taxi stops. Better use
them. Take a look at the prices (usually located on back seat window), and make
sure that the “TRANSPORT (leva per km)” prices are not more than 1.00 lv.

## Hotels

There are many hotels around the venue. We recommend you book one in downtown
Sofia, perfectly, in a walking distance of the venue. As usual, the earlier you
book, the better chances you have to get a room at a conveniently close hotel.

The ones closest to the venue are:

- [Hilton Sofia](http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/bulgaria/hilton-sofia-SOFHIHI/index.html)
- [Central Park Hotel Sofia](http://centralparkhotel.bg)
- [Hotel Downtown Sofia](http://hotel-downtown.net)

There are some cheaper alternatives, which are also close-by:

- [Best Western Art Plaza Hotel](http://artplazahotel.bg)
- [Hotel Niky](http://hotel-niky.com)


If you feel like it, you can choose to stay at one of these fancy hostels:

- [Art Hostel](http://www.art-hostel.com)
- [Hostel "Mostel"](http://www.hostelmostel.com)

And, of course, Airbnb is always an option. Make sure to book early in order to
get the closest and cheapest listings. If you don’t find anything suitable
around the venue, check out the listings around underground stations, such as
Joliot Curie, James Bourchier, European Union.

Hope you've found this info useful. In our next blog post, we will learn some
more about the city and its sights. Stay tuned!
