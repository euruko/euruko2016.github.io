Hello there fine folks, hope you are having a great Monday! As EuRuKo is run by
community volunteers each year, we feel it is important for us to make it as
accessible as possible to everyone. This is why we want to offer a bunch of
free tickets.

## Sponsorship

Are you a member of a social minority underrepresented in technology? Are you a
student, or a beginner who feels uncertain whether they are ready to attend a
conference? And are you passionate about Ruby and the community?

If the answer to any of the questions above is **YES**, you can apply for a
free ticket. We offer a limited number of them.

## Application

To apply, fill out [this form][form]. Feel free to nominate a friend as well!
We will try our best to get back to you as soon as we can.

_(All of your answers will be available only to us, the conference organizers.
We won't be giving this data to anyone else.)_

May the Ruby be with you!
