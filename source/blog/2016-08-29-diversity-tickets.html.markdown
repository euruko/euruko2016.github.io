Hello there fine folks, hope you are having a great Monday! As EuRuKo is run by
community volunteers each year, we feels it is important for us to make it as
accessible to anyone as we can. This is why we want to offer a bunch of
free tickets.

## Sponsorship

Do you feel you represent a minority? Or maybe you represent the LGBTQ
community? Are you a student who cannot afford the price of admission?

If the answer to any of the questions above is **YES**, and you are passionate
about Ruby, we want to have you here!

## Application

To apply, fill out this form. Feel free to nominate a friend as well! We will
try our best to get back to you as soon as we can.

_(All of your answers will be available only to us, the conference organizers.
We won't be giving this data to anyone else.)_

## Fairness

Please be fair and only apply for the tickets, if you cannot afford them. We
offer a limited number of them.

May the Ruby be with you!
