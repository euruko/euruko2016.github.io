## EuRuKo.next

Every year EuRuKo attendees vote for the next city to host the conference.
The voting will happen at the conference after party, which will be held on
Friday night, 23th of September.

If you want to pitch your favourite European city and organize EuRuKo in it,
prepare a short presentation and 3 minutes of awesome words about the city.
Oh, and remember – you **will** organize the **whole** the conference, should
you win. Be prepared for that as well. :-)
