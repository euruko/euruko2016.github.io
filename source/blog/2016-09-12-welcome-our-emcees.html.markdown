Let's give a warm welcome to our two wonderful emcees!

## Monica Giambitto

Backend engineer at Freeletics in love with Ruby elegance and simplicity since
2011. Passionate about testing, the people side of our industry, and building
bridges between engineers and the business people. Rails Girls coach, tweeting
as <a href="https://twitter.com/KFMolli">@KFMolli</a>.

## Valentin Mihov

<a href="https://github.com/valo">Valentin</a> started programming in high
school with participating in algorithm competitions. One thing led to another
and he ended up doing Ruby for pleasure and profit for the last 8 years. Apart
from the regular backend stuff, he has been involved in several machine
learning and performance projects. He really enjoys peeking under the hood and
finding performance problems.
