The response for this year’s EuRuKo is outstanding! That’s why we decided to
organize a small pre-registration event for those of you, who will be in Sofia
on 22nd September. Thanks to our amazing friends at [CowOrKing Space by Puzl](http://coworking.puzl.com),
we’ll be able to host the early registration on Thursday at their coworking
space.

**CowOrKing**

CowOrKing Space by Puzl is one of the fastest growing coworking spaces in
Bulgaria and is currently on a mission to facilitate the community of
innovative Bulgarian startups in the IT industry. It seems there’s no better
place for us to be at! Check out their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CowOrKingSpaceByPuzl) and don’t forget to show
them some love and support!

**Early Registration**

Come grab your badge on Thursday and help us offload the lines on Friday. The
beer and pizza will be on us!

**[Be sure to let us know through this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9egnQG6UJnrzAR877bo83wqbrBYLPa9uAbx0l9bxtMRt83Q/viewform),
so we can prepare your badge.**

Here’s the deal:

- **22.09, Thursday**
- **17:00 – 20:00**
- **CowOrKing Space by Puzl**, bul. Cherni Vrah 47A, floor 4 (you can get there by
metro – take the <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; ">blue</span> line to the [Vitosha Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitosha_Metro_Station)).

You'll recognize the tall building by a big sign that says “SIVEN”. The main
entrance is a sliding door right next to the entrance of LIDL supermarket. Once
you’re there, just take the elevator to floor 4.

See you there!
