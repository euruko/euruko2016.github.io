## PS

_* Preparation can happen any time before the time of presentation, even after registering ;) You can also opt to go without a presentation (not recommended)._

_** You have a ticket, right? If not, you only have 10 more days to get one!_

_*** Make sure to have the presentation on a flash drive, or to have sent it to us at hi@euruko2016.org with the subject “EuRuKo 2017”_

_**** A simple slideshow of pictures is a good presentation, no need to overdo it._
